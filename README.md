# [Axel's Personal Site](https://laxels.com/)

Hi there! This is a site I made as a mini-portfolio.
It encompasses my work as a developer from 2011 to 2018.


## Technical Details

At its core, it's just a static site scaffolded by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
As such, many parts are left as the default configuration with minor tweaks.

Uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router).
Everything is written in Vanilla JS(X) and CSS for simplicity.
